Additional fields containing genotypes for one or more samples may also be present. In our VCF files we have the FORMAT column and multiple sample columns.</i></p>

    <p class="prg-menu"><i>Each row of the file contains information about observed variants at the given position and chromosome. Files can contain information for a single or multiple samples corresponding to one or more columns, each column with double information (genotype) for autosomal chromosomes.</i></p>

    <p class="prg-menu"><i>The ped and map formats are complementing type of files that are the most commonly used type of format in GWAS and they were implemented by the software PLINK (Purcell et al. 2007). The transformation from the retrieved VCF files data to these files is very straightforward.</i></p>
